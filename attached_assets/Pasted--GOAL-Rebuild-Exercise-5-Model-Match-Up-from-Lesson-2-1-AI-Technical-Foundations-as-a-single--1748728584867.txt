## GOAL
Rebuild Exercise 5: “Model Match-Up” from Lesson 2.1 (AI Technical Foundations) as a single-screen, card-based UI that helps learners classify AI use cases and identify inputs/outputs.

## UI DESIGN
Display 10 AI use cases in card format on a responsive grid layout. Each card includes:
- **Use Case Title**
- **Tag Picker:** Select one or more tags from “AI”, “ML”, “DL”
  - Tags appear as styled toggle pills
  - Multi-select is allowed
- **Text Input:** “What kind of input does this use?”
- **Text Input:** “What kind of output does this produce?”
- **Help Icon:** When clicked, opens a popover or modal with a helpful tip for that use case
- State is saved to localStorage and restored on refresh

## FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- All state is stored in localStorage
- Inputs and tags are auto-saved on change
- Help icon reveals a contextual tip based on course content

## USE CASE CARDS
Use the following 10 cards and include the provided help tip for each:

1. **Netflix Recommendations**
   - Help Tip: Think about how past behavior influences future suggestions. This is a classic pattern-learning use case (ML) where the more you interact, the more the model adapts.

2. **Facial Recognition**
   - Help Tip: Deep Learning thrives on image data. This system learns to match patterns in facial features from large datasets of labeled images.

3. **ChatGPT / LLMs**
   - Help Tip: LLMs use embeddings, transformers, and self-attention to generate text. This is deep learning—multiple layers interpreting complex language patterns.

4. **Google Translate**
   - Help Tip: This uses ML and DL under the hood, especially for context-aware translations. Think about the sequence of tokens and meaning representations.

5. **Autonomous Vehicles**
   - Help Tip: This is deep learning in action: it takes in real-time sensor inputs and outputs decisions like steering or braking. Pattern recognition at speed.

6. **Fraud Detection in Banking**
   - Help Tip: Machine Learning systems here learn from millions of transactions to spot abnormal behavior. You may not need images—just lots of labeled behavior data.

7. **AI Art Generation (e.g., DALL·E)**
   - Help Tip: This is generative DL. A text input leads to a totally new image output, combining vision and language models.

8. **Smart Home Voice Assistant**
   - Help Tip: This blends ML for intent recognition and sometimes DL for speech processing. It uses your voice as input, actions or answers as output.

9. **Medical Imaging Diagnostics**
   - Help Tip: A prime DL use case—models learn from thousands of X-rays or scans to predict diagnoses. High-volume, high-accuracy image classification.

10. **Real-Time Language Captioning**
   - Help Tip: DL models process audio inputs and convert them into text in real time. Consider the data type (sound) and required speed.

## STYLING
- Tailwind CSS for layout, spacing, and themes
- Light/dark mode toggle (stored in localStorage)
- Cards are modern, rounded, responsive, and styled cleanly
- Help icon: `?` badge in top-right of each card, opens a popover/modal on click
